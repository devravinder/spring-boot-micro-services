1. in open api we're dynamically adding the swagger urls
    with the help of
         custom-info-1 ( application.yaml ) & custom-info-2 (SwaggerConfig.java) code snippets
    see: SwaggerConfig.java

    Note:- to enable autoconfiguration
        comment out the custom-info-1 & custom-info-2 code snippets
        uncomment the custom-info-3 code snippet ( in application.yaml )



2. We are doing custom configuration
   so that the routes that are defined under 'routes' in application.yaml
      will be added to swagger documentation ( ui )


   else we have to add statically  in application.yaml
     under  'swagger-ui.urls'
          with service name & url



 i.e we are doing custom configuration to eliminate statically adding open api urls to swagger

   then there will be an issue...in calling apis from the api-gateway UI
     - bcz
         the service  url points docker service name ( host name )
         eg: http://order-service:8082/api/orders


   to fix this,
      we need to map all the service names to localhost (in /etc/hosts )

      like
      127.0.0.1 order-service
      127.0.0.1 catalog-service
      127.0.0.1 notification-service


After combing all the services open api urls in api-gateway,
   still when we try t
